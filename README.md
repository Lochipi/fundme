## Fund me project

This is a funding project that uses of-chain data to determine price, and calculate the amount of tokens to be minted in USD.

### get started

```bash
npm install
```

you can also run `npm install @chainlink/contracts --save` to install the chainlink contracts.

Note: I have used the chainlink contracts to get the price of the token, and the amount of tokens to be minted. 

Sepolia is used to deploy the contract to the sepolia testnet network, and the address is `0x6B2a9c3bC0C22B23dc8049282671f31c238954eb`.

You can also view it on etherscan [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x163a86eee15155e59a425948a951a5abde06477a4ed931c49968e1ca501021fe).

You can experiment the contract on the Sepolia testnet network, or use remix to demo it.
